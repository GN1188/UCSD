The reference script below provides template code and hints to help with each step.  \n","Note, in the lecture and in most literature, the Lasso regression regularization parameter is denoted as \"lambda\", but in the sklearn model, it is called \"alpha\".\n","\n","-  **Step 1**:  Download the dataset file from the Github repository for this course (the link is provided in the materials document in the LMS).  Upload the file to your Colab files folder so that you can access it from your script. Read in the provided csv file: \"BreastCancerDataset.csv\" into a pandas dataframe.  Note the dataset has been prepared to include all the features used in the study as well as a \"Diagnosis\" column.  You MUST use this file in your project.\n","-  **Step 2**:  Inspect the dataset, note the features (indep vars) and the result (last column). Drop any unwanted rows or columns from the dataframe (e.g. 'unnamed')\n","-  **Step 3**:  Read the features (all but the 'Diagnosis' column) into a numpy array.\n","-  **Step 4**:  Read the results column ('Diagnosis') into the Y variable\n","-  **Step 5**:  Create a training and test split of 70% train and 30% test from the dataset. Use a random_state of 31.\n","-  **Step 6**:  Train the Lasso algorithm, using the default fit function (alpha=1.0).
