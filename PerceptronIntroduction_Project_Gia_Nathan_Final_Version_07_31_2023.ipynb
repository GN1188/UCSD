Here is a possible explanation. In the two dimension space, plotting the points (0, 0), (1, 1)  both map to 0 in XOR, and (0, 1), (1, 0) which both map to 1 in XOR. So there is no straight line (in other words a linear boundary) which will separate the two classes of points. So it it highly likely that is why the tests for the XOR functions fail in my case while all other cases are passing. Another reason could be due to the fact that this is a single-layer Perceptron based model, which is a linear model,  unable to  solve these types of problems."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ro44uMYXbHt6"},"source":["## Test binary classifier\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"PKRy266ZbSyv","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1690905691788,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":20,"user":{"displayName":"Gia Nathan","userId":"13214133616904326521"}},"outputId":"9a52ef18-e403-4edf-bb53-ea590249b0f4","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["TestResults(failed=0, attempted=4)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":7}],"source":["#Test the Perceptron model\n","\n","#Test X and y\n","X = []\n","X.append(np.array([-1,5]))     #class0\n","X.append(np.array([-1,7]))     #class0\n","X.append(np.array([0,4]))      #class0\n","X.append(np.array([1,6]))      #class0\n","X.append(np.array([4,4]))      #class0\n","X.append(np.array([4,8]))      #class0\n","X.append(np.array([-4,2]))     #class1\n","X.append(np.array([-6,-1]))    #class1\n","X.append(np.array([-7,2]))     #class1\n","X.append(np.array([-7,4]))     #class1\n","X.append(np.array([-9,0]))     #class1\n","X.append(np.array([-9,3]))     #class1\n","\n","y = np.array([0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1])\n","\n","\n","#Construct Perceptron object\n","#   num of inputs = number of indep variables (input nodes)\n","#   epochs = 50\n","#   learning rate = 1\n","#perceptron = Perceptron(None, None, None)\n","\n","\n","perceptron = Perceptron(2, 50, 1)\n","\n","#Train the network\n","\n","#perceptron.train(None, None)\n","\n","perceptron.train(X, y)\n","\n","import doctest\n","\n","\"\"\"\n","  >>> print(perceptron.predict(np.array([-3, -1])))\n","  1\n","  >>> print(perceptron.predict(np.array([2, 3])))\n","  0\n","  >>> print(perceptron.predict(np.array([-10, 4])))\n","  1\n","  >>> print(perceptron.predict(np.array([-3, 8])))\n","  0\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","doctest.testmod()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"cET6CmBFBvgj"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.5"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
